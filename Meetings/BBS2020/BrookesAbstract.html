      The GenApp framework was developed to meet the needs of CCP-SAS to
	  easily bring a variety of SAS analysis and simulation software to the
	  web. This framework is used to produce SASSIE-web and other SAS and
	  non-SAS web portals or “science gateways”. Recently, many enhancements
	  and improvements have been added to GenApp. This talk will provide a
	  brief background on GenApp, overview deployed applications, and provide
	  a summary of recent updates.
