This talk will be divided in two parts:
<p>
Initially I’ll talk about some recent work we have carried out using Dissipative Particle Dynamics to characterize the phase diagram
of surfactant solutions and how our results compare with scattering data. In the next part of the talk I’ll discuss the plan we are putting
forward to continue the activity of the CCP5 and how this would involve tight integration with experiments.
