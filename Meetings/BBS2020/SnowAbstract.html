      Since the beginning of the joint US-UK CCP-SAS endeavour there was a desire to cater to, at least, the fields
	  of biological and soft condensed matter scattering. Initial progress in in the collaborative project had a bias towards
	  the analysis of biological systems, driven, in part, by the low barrier to obtaining initial trajectories for molecular
	  dynamics simulations based on atomic models obtained via crystallographic investigations.
<p>
      Historically, for soft matter systems, no such ‘springboard’ existed presenting a large barrier towards adoption, however,
	  more recently advances have been made in this area. This talk will present progress made with one such endeavour currently
	  under development as part of a collaborative project between the Diamond and ISIS central facilities and the Daresbury
	  Computing Laboratory
