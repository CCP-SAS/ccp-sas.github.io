      CCP-SAS: New developments in computational modelling of X-ray and neutron scattering curves</br>

	  This CCP-SAS Workshop is being held as a satellite to the <a href="https://britishbiophysics.org/posts/2020/2020-06-01-bbs2020online/">
	  60th anniversary meeting</a> of the <a href="https://britishbiophysics.org/"> British Biophysical Society</a>.
	  Originally scheduled to be held in Nottigham, the meeting has moved to a virutal venue/format in response to the
	  Covid-19 pandemic and travel and meeting restrictions that followed thereon.  While changing to a vitual
	  venue has required some difficult adjustments, it has also presented some new opportunities to reach more people.
	  <p>
	  The goal of this mini-workshop are twofold: To provide a training opportunity for persons interested in
	  learning how to use simulations tools in fitting SAS data and to bring the community together to hear a
	  little bit about recent uses of these tools and learn about the latest developments in the project.
	
	  <p>
	  <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">NOTE:</span> Registration is <i>free</i> but is needed for security
	  reasons to provide all the participants access to the virtual venue.  The tutorial portion is now closed and no longer
	  accepting registrant but participants are still welcome to register to join the plenary session in the afternoon.
