      <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">NOTE:</span> While there is no fee for attending this Workshop,
	  it is being held on the NIST campus. As such all participants will be required to register with NIST
	  <b><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">BEFORE May 13, 2016</span></b> in order to gain access!
	  	  
	  <p>This Workshop follows on from the previous two workshops at NIST in February 2014 and
	  Diamond in October of 2014 and the interim closed project meeting held at SAS-2015 in Berlin
	  in September 2015. The Workshop will consist of three parts.  On Monday will be the presentation sessions
	  of broad interest to the scientific community. Attendees are encouraged to bring posters explaining
	  their use of these kinds of modeling techniques or illustrating their need for such.  Tuesday morning will
	  be devoted to a meeting between the CCP-SAS project and individuals or institutions with activities in
	  related software development areas, interests in participating in the CCP-SAS current or projected activities
	  and facilities with potential interest in deploying CCP-SAS products on their servers for use by their users
	  and thus have a potential interest in helping with maintenance activities.  Discussions will focus on current
	  activities, directions and needs with a goal of elucidating adjustments to CCP-SAS activities in the remaining
	  funding cycle, and, more importantly of developing collaborations with other projects and identifying areas for
	  joint funding applications moving forward. Finally on Wednesday there will be two hands on tutorial sessions:
	  How to wrap existing code using GenApp to produce a web GUI and run on a cluster backend, and code development
	  in the SASSIE framework.
	  </p>
	  </p>

	  <!--Whereas that Workshop was concerned with the wider context of CCP-SAS, the opportunities and challenges
	  for it to contribute to bio-oriented soft matter science, and the foundations on which the Project
	  would be built, this Second Workshop will be concerned with what has been developed to date, and how
	  the capability of CCP-SAS can be extended to more mainstream soft matter science such as the
	  simulation of micelles/vesicles/synthetic polymers. There will also be presentations on the 
	  wider, but related, CCP portfolio and UK supercomputing infrastructure.
	  <p>
	  <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">NOTE:</span> As the Workshop will be held at the Science & 
	  Technology Facility Council's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, home to the Diamond Light Source, registration 
	  is mandatory in order to gain access. Registration is <i>free</i> but will be on a first-come, first-served 
	  basis until the maximum attendance is reached (~100 for Mon 6 Oct). <b>Registration will close on Monday 8 September.</b>
	  <p>
	  <b>The first day of the Workshop (Monday 6 October) is open to all interested members of the scientific 
      community. Delegates are encouraged to consider presenting posters.</b> Lunch and refreshments will be provided.
	  <p>
	  <b>There will also be a developers meeting on Wednesday 8 October</b> which anyone interested in contributing 
	  software and expertise to the Project is welcome to attend. If this interests you, please contact <a href="mailto:dave.wright@ucl.ac.uk">Dr David Wright</a> as soon as possible. Tuesday 7 October will be devoted to 
      organizing the activities of the Project and is restricted to Project members and others specifically invited 
	  to contribute.
