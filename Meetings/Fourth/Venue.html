      <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">NOTE:</span> While there is no fee for attending this Workshop,
	  it is being held on the NIST campus. As such all participants will be required to register with NIST
	  <b><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">BEFORE May 13, 2016</span></b> in order to gain access!
	  	  
	  <p>This Workshop follows on from the previous two workshops at NIST in February 2014 and
	  Diamond in October of 2014 and the interim closed project meeting held at SAS-2015 in Berlin
	  in September 2015. The Workshop will consist of three parts.  On Monday will be the presentation sessions
	  of broad interest to the scientific community. Attendees are encouraged to bring posters explaining
	  their use of these kinds of modeling techniques or illustrating their need for such.  Tuesday morning will
	  be devoted to a meeting between the CCP-SAS project and individuals or institutions with activities in
	  related software development areas, interests in participating in the CCP-SAS current or projected activities
	  and facilities with potential interest in deploying CCP-SAS products on their servers for use by their users
	  and thus have a potential interest in helping with maintenance activities.  Discussions will focus on current
	  activities, directions and needs with a goal of elucidating adjustments to CCP-SAS activities in the remaining
	  funding cycle, and, more importantly of developing collaborations with other projects and identifying areas for
	  joint funding applications moving forward. Finally on Wednesday there will be two hands on tutorial sessions:
	  How to wrap existing code using GenApp to produce a web GUI and run on a cluster backend, and code development
	  in the SASSIE framework.

	 The easiest way to travel to the hotels from any of the three nearby airports is to go to the airport shared ride
	 counters and book a shuttle.  Cost should be on the order of $35-$45/person.  For larger groups a taxi will probably
	 be more economical.
