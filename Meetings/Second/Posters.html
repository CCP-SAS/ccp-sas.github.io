   careful thought. As a "meeting" page the MeetingStyle sheet is in play and this container
   should only be used as the container for the elements of the meetings page: title and intro blocks 
   which span the width of the page followed by a sidebar navigation block and the main content block.

	  community discussion and feedback day, and is being held on the NIST campus.  As such all 
	  participants for this day must register with NIST in order to gain access. If you wish to
	  attend please register <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">BY January 23, 2014</span>
	  at the <a href="https://www-s.nist.gov/NCNR-IMS/externalVisitorRegistration.do">NCNR Visitor

	  <p>
	  This Friday session will be held at the NCNR on the NIST campus - bldg 235 Room K04B
	  </p>
