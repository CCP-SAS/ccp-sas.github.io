	  This Workshop will follow on from that held at NIST Gaithersburg, USA in February 2014.

	  Whereas that Workshop was concerned with the wider context of CCP-SAS, the opportunities and challenges
	  for it to contribute to bio-oriented soft matter science, and the foundations on which the Project
	  would be built, this Second Workshop will be concerned with what has been developed to date, and how
	  the capability of CCP-SAS can be extended to more mainstream soft matter science such as the
	  simulation of micelles/vesicles/synthetic polymers. There will also be presentations on the 
	  wider, but related, CCP portfolio and UK supercomputing infrastructure.
	  <p>
	  <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">NOTE:</span> As the Workshop will be held at the Science & 
	  Technology Facility Council's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, home to the Diamond Light Source, registration 
	  is mandatory in order to gain access. Registration is <i>free</i> but will be on a first-come, first-served 
	  basis until the maximum attendance is reached (~100 for Mon 6 Oct). <b>Registration will close on Monday 8 September.</b>
	  <p>
	  <b>The first day of the Workshop (Monday 6 October) is open to all interested members of the scientific 
      community. Delegates are encouraged to consider presenting posters.</b> Lunch and refreshments will be provided.
	  <p>
	  <b>There will also be a developers meeting on Wednesday 8 October</b> which anyone interested in contributing 
	  software and expertise to the Project is welcome to attend. If this interests you, please contact <a href="mailto:dave.wright@ucl.ac.uk">Dr David Wright</a> as soon as possible. Tuesday 7 October will be devoted to 
      organizing the activities of the Project and is restricted to Project members and others specifically invited 
	  to contribute.

	 General Information
	 </div>   
	 The Diamond Light Source is located at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) on the Harwell Oxford 
	 Science & Innovation Campus in South Oxfordshire, UK, approximately 15 miles (25 km) south of Oxford. 

	 <h3>Travelling to RAL/Diamond</h3>
	 The nearest major airports are London Heathrow (LHR) and Birmingham (BHX). European delegates may find it easier 
	 and cheaper to use London City (LCY), London Luton (LTN) or Southampton (SOU).
	 <p>
	 The nearest railway station is Didcot Parkway (DID, 6 miles/10 km) on the mainline between London 
	 Paddington (PAD) and the West of England/South Wales. If travelling from the north or south, change 
     at Oxford or Reading for services to Didcot.
	 <p>
	 There is a reasonably frequent bus service from Oxford and Didcot to the Harwell Oxford Campus (Service numbers 
	 <a href="http://www.thames-travel.co.uk/timetables-fares/oxfordshire-and-reading/x32/">X1/X32</a>) during 
     working hours.

	 <p>

	 <h3>Access to RAL Site</h3>
	 On arrival delegates will need to report to the Visitor Reception at the RAL Main Gate to collect a 
	 site pass. A site pass will only be available to those that have registered in advance for the Workshop.

	 <h3>Accommodation</h3>
	 Most delegates will only attend the Workshop on Monday 6 October and so should not require accommodation. 
	 Where accommodation <i>is</i> required, delegates are responsible for arranging it and paying for it themselves. 
	 There is very limited hotel/motel accommodation within 8 miles (12 km) of the Campus.
	 <p>
	 A limited number of rooms are available in the Ridgeway House hostel on the Harwell Oxford Campus for use by 
	 Project partners. To book these rooms it will be necessary to quote a code that will be distributed separately.

	 <h3>Posters</h3>
	 Delegates are encouraged to consider presenting posters on work using or related to CCP-SAS. The display board 
	 size is A0 Portrait. Titles should be supplied during the registration process.
