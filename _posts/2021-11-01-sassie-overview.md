SASSIE and SASSIE-web offer user-friendly interfaces to build and simulate molecular models based on small-angle scattering data. These tools allow users to import molecular structures, run simulations, and compare results to experimental scattering profiles. Visit the [SASSIE-web portal](https://sassie-web.chem.utk.edu/) to learn more.
