**CCP-SAS** is a joint US/UK effort to develop open-source software infrastructure for atomistic
and coarse-grained modeling of small-angle scattering (SAS) data from biological and soft matter systems.

We provide <a href="/software/">modeling tools</a> that bridge experimental SAS data and structural models 
using molecular simulation and computational analysis. Our efforts aim to accelerate scientific discovery through 
reproducible, extensible tools supported by an international collaborative community.
