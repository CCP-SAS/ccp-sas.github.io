The CCP-SAS project was initiated through a joint NSF/EPSRC grant. Ongoing
development of the GenApp framework, SASSIE-web, and related deployment
continues with support from various sources, including NSF, NIST, and EPSRC.
Strategic planning and coordination are overseen by a UK/US Leadership Council,
which meets approximately once a month.
