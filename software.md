The 'user gateway' to the software available under the CCP-SAS project is a website we call SASSIE-Web.

To use SASSIE-Web, click on the red link below to be re-directed to our Web Portal.

If this is your first time, you will need to register before you can login to the Web Portal. To register,
just click on the 'human' icon in the top-right corner of the Web Portal screen and complete the form.

If you are a returning user, just login.

The Feedback tab on the right of the Web Portal screen may be used to leave suggestions, raise important questions
or to notify the developers of critical problems.


Other Applications
The GenApp infrastructure that we use to deploy SASSIE-Web is increasingly being used to deploy other applications
as well, including:

* [Denfert](https://genapp.rocks/denfert) - for ab initio "dummy-atom" structural modeling of biological macromolecules
* [SOMO](https://genapp.rocks/somo)- for calculating hydrodynamic parameters of macromolecules from structural models
* [VIV](http://js-172-198.jetstream-cloud.org/vortexshedding) - vortex-induced vibration simulation
